# Advent of Code 2021

Hereby, I solve the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) in R. Just having some nerdy fun. :laughing::nerd_face:

All my solutions are in the file [AdventOfCode2021.R](AdventOfCode2021.R). There is a section for each challenge. Do not expect the more sophisticated or optimized solutions. Tbh, I have struggled and googled a lot in the process.
